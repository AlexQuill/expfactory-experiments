# The Experiment Factory Experiments

Each folder contains a javascript experiment that can be deployed into an [experiment battery instance](http://www.github.com/expfactory/expfactory-battery), which is a psiturk battery experiment. You can browse the currently valid experiments [here](http://expfactory.github.io/expfactory-experiments/), and download meta data at the bottom of that page. For details about folder contents, and generating new experiments, please see our [documentation](http://expfactory.readthedocs.org)
